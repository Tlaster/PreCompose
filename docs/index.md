Compose Multiplatform Navigation && ViewModel, inspired by Jetpack Lifecycle, ViewModel, LiveData and Navigation, PreCompose provides similar (or even the same) components for you but in Kotlin, and it's Kotlin Multiplatform project.

# Why PreCompose
- Write your business logic and UI code once in one `commonMain`, and your application can be anywhere, powered by Kotlin and Compose!
- If you familiar with Jetpack Lifecycle, ViewModel and Navigation, there will be nothing to lean.
- Super easy to set up.
- No need to write platform-specific code and UI.
- Lifecycle is handled by PreCompose, you don't need to worry about it.
